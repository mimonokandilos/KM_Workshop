# WHAT IS C++?
- C++ is a high-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s. It is an extension of the C programming language with object-oriented programming (OOP) features, which allow developers to structure code in terms of objects and classes.

C++ is widely used for developing system/application software, game development, embedded systems, device drivers, operating systems, and many other types of software. It's known for its efficiency, flexibility, and performance, making it a popular choice for developing performance-critical applications.Some key features of C++ include:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): C++ supports the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, allowing developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
Compiled Language: C++ code needs to be compiled into machine code before it can be executed. This compilation process allows C++ programs to achieve high performance.
- Rich Standard Library: C++ comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides a wide range of functions and classes for various purposes, such as input/output operations, string manipulation, containers (like vectors, lists, maps), algorithms, and more.
- Low-level Manipulation: C++ allows low-level manipulation of memory through features like pointers, which can be both powerful and error-prone if not used carefully.
- Platform Portability: C++ code can be compiled to run on different platforms with minimal changes, making it suitable for cross-platform development.
- Performance: C++ is known for its efficiency and performance, making it suitable for applications where speed and resource usage are critical.
